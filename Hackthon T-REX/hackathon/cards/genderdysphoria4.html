        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>ADHD, categorized between 80-100, indicates mild symptoms and better functional abilities. Individuals in this range might face occasional challenges in attention and focus, but these difficulties do not significantly impair daily activities. They may require minimal support and can generally manage their responsibilities without severe disruptions.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="diagnosis">
        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
     <br>   <p>SYMPTOMS->
<br>            1.Difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities: Easily distracted, difficulty focusing on one task.
    <br>        2.Frequent careless mistakes: Lack of attention to detail, leading to errors in schoolwork or other activities.
        <br>    3.Doesn't seem to listen: Appears not to hear when spoken to directly.
            <br>4.Difficulty organizing tasks and activities: Messy, disorganized work; poor time management.
           <br> 5.Avoids or dislikes tasks requiring sustained mental effort: Procrastination, avoids tasks that require focus.
            <br>
            <br>
            DIAGNOSIS->
           <br> Inattention: Symptoms in this category include difficulty sustaining attention, making careless mistakes, being forgetful in daily activities, having difficulty organizing tasks, avoiding or being reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort, and being easily distracted.
            <br>
            <br>Hyperactivity-Impulsivity: Symptoms in this category include fidgeting or tapping hands or feet, restlessness, being unable to stay seated in situations where it's expected, talking excessively, interrupting or intruding on others' conversations or games, and difficulty waiting one's turn.
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="causes">
        <h2>Causes</h2>
       <br> <p>1.Proper Nutrition: A balanced diet rich in essential nutrients, especially omega-3 fatty acids, has been linked to healthy brain development and a reduced risk of ADHD symptoms.
           <br> 2.Adequate Sleep: Regular and sufficient sleep is crucial for brain function and emotional regulation. Children and adults who consistently get enough sleep are less likely to exhibit ADHD-like behaviors.
<br>            3.Limited Screen Time: Excessive screen time, especially at a young age, has been associated with attention problems. Limiting screen time and promoting outdoor activities and social interactions can reduce the risk of ADHD symptoms.
    <br>        4.Positive Social Relationships: Strong, positive relationships with family members, peers, and teachers can provide emotional support and reduce stress, contributing to lower levels of ADHD symptoms.
        <br>    5.Effective Coping Strategies: Teaching children effective coping strategies for managing stress and frustration can enhance their ability to regulate emotions and behavior, reducing ADHD-related challenges.
            <br>6.Early Intervention and Support: Identifying and addressing learning difficulties or behavioral challenges early in life can prevent them from escalating into full-blown ADHD symptoms. Early intervention and support services are crucial.
            <br>
            <br>Remember that these points represent possible factors associated with lower levels of ADHD symptoms based on existing research. However, individual cases can vary, and ADHD is a complex condition influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurological factors.</p>

    <div class="container" id="prevention">
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
       <br> <h3>Foods to Eat</h3>
      <br>  <p>1.Dairy or Dairy Alternatives: Milk, yogurt, and fortified plant-based milk provide calcium and vitamin D, which are important for brain health.
          <br>  2.Limit Processed Foods: Foods high in sugar, artificial additives, and preservatives should be limited, as they can worsen ADHD symptoms in some individuals.
           <br> 3.Stay Hydrated: Proper hydration is crucial for overall brain function. Encourage drinking water throughout the day.
           <br> 4.Supplements: In some cases, supplements like iron, zinc, magnesium, and B vitamins might be recommended if there are deficiencies, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional before taking any supplements.</p>
      <br>  <h3>Medication</h3>
       <br> <p>For individuals with low-level ADHD symptoms (scored 0-20 on an ADHD assessment), healthcare providers might recommend non-pharmacological interventions first. These can include behavioral therapy, psychoeducation, lifestyle modifications, and organizational strategies to manage symptoms.
<br>
    <br>        If symptoms persist and are significantly impacting daily functioning, healthcare providers might consider medication options. The choice of medication and dosage depends on various factors, including the individual's specific symptoms, medical history, and response to different medications. Some commonly prescribed medications for ADHD include:
        <br>    
            <br>1.Stimulant Medications:
          <br>  Methylphenidate-based medications: Examples include Ritalin, Concerta, and Daytrana.
           <br> Amphetamine-based medications: Examples include Adderall, Vyvanse, and Dexedrine.
            <br>
            2.Non-Stimulant Medications:
          <br>  Atomoxetine (Strattera): This is a non-stimulant medication that affects the norepinephrine neurotransmitter system.
            <br>Bupropion (Wellbutrin): Although primarily used as an antidepressant, it can also be prescribed for ADHD, especially in cases where stimulant medications are not suitable.</p>
       <br> <h3>Exercises</h3>
        <br><p>1.Deep Breathing Exercises:
        <br>    Practice deep breathing exercises like diaphragmatic breathing or alternate nostril breathing. Deep breathing helps calm the mind and improve focus.
          <br>  
            2.Balasana:
       <br>     a.Start on your hands and knees.
           <br> b.Sit back on your heels while reaching your arms forward on the ground.
          <br>  c.Rest your forehead on the mat and breathe deeply.
          <br>  d.Hold for a few minutes, focusing on relaxing your body and mind.
           <br> 
          <br>  3.Mountain Pose (Tadasana):
       <br>     Improve posture and balance with the mountain pose. Stand tall, feet together, arms by your sides, and focus on your breathing to find stability.</p>
